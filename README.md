### Installation

For those brave souls who want to build the app themselves, follow these steps. Otherwise, feel free to **download the pre-built executable** from the [releases page](https://github.com/KaonWry/Patriot-Converter/releases/latest) and extract the downloaded file.

#### **Requirements**

- Python 3.x
- PyInstaller

#### **Steps to Build**

1. **Download the repository** or clone it:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/PatriotConverter.git
    cd PatriotConverter
    ```

2. **Run the `build.bat` file**:
    - Inside the project folder, you’ll find a `build.bat` file.
    - Simply run `build.bat` to build the app.

    This will install necessary dependencies, set up PyInstaller, and create the executable. The output will be located in the `/dist/` folder.

    The `build.bat` script will:
    - Install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
    - Use PyInstaller to create the executable
    - Include necessary `.ui` files for the app

    This will create the executable in the `/dist/` folder.

### Acknowledgements

- **PySide6**: For providing the powerful and flexible framework that allows me to make this beautiful shitpost.
  
- **To my American friends**: Thank you for keeping the imperial system alive. Your dedication to using units like "basketball courts" and "bananas" continues to inspire the rest of us. This app is for you, and we’re all here, quietly waiting for the day you finally adopt the metric system!
